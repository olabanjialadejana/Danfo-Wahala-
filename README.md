# Danfo-Wahala ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“

This program attempts to mimic the problematic nature of public transit bus in Lagos state, Nigeria.
It mimics the old VW Vanagon buses used loved by the lagos transporters.
The program asks the user for his destination, receives cash from the user and takes them to their destination

## Key steps in the project

I moved through these key steps:
1. Created several classes to handle key tasks done throughout the transportation process:
    
    1. All attributes and methods of the MoneyCollection class (representing the 
   job description of a typical conductor) 
    ![img_2.png](img_2.png)
    2. All attributes and methods of the DanfoDestination class 
   (this models all the predetermined destinations of the driver/conductor)
    3. All attributes of the Volkswagen Vanagon bus 
   (petrol, engine_oil, and water for radiator)

2. The code proper
